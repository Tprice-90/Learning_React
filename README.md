-I will be using the React website tutorial (https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) to 
 begin learning how to create React SPA's
-First step is to use NPX to initialize the app, requires Node >= 14.0 and NPM >= 5.6, will confirm 
 these versions first.
 -Node is not yet installed, will install now.
